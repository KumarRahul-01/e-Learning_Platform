    {
      "questionId": 1,
      "question": "What does GAI stand for in the context of artificial intelligence?",
      "options": [
        "General Artificial Intelligence",
        "Generative Artificial Intelligence",
        "Graphical Artificial Intelligence",
        "Global Artificial Intelligence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "GAI stands for Generative Artificial Intelligence, which refers to AI systems that can create new content like text, images, and code."
    },
    {
      "questionId": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following is a popular large language model developed by OpenAI?",
      "options": ["BERT", "ChatGPT", "DALL-E", "LLaMA"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ChatGPT is a well-known conversational AI model developed by OpenAI based on GPT architecture. While DALL-E and LLaMA are also OpenAI/Meta models, ChatGPT is the most famous for text generation."
    },
    {
      "questionId": 3,
      "question": "What is the primary training objective of transformer-based language models like GPT?",
      "options": [
        "Image classification",
        "Predicting the next token in a sequence",
        "Real-time translation",
        "Video summarization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Transformer-based language models are trained using unsupervised learning to predict the next token (word or subword) in a sequence, which helps them learn language patterns."
    },
    {
      "questionId": 4,
      "question": "Which technique allows a generative AI model to perform tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on?",
      "options": [
        "Reinforcement Learning",
        "Supervised Learning",
        "Prompt Engineering",
        "Data Augmentation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Prompt Engineering is the technique of crafting specific inputs (prompts) to guide generative AI models to perform desired tasks effectively without additional training."
    },
    {
      "questionId": 5,
      "question": "What is a major ethical concern with generative AI models?",
      "options": [
        "They are too expensive to run",
        "They can generate biased or misinformation content",
        "They require constant human supervision",
        "They can only process text data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A significant ethical concern is that generative AI models can perpetuate biases from their training data and generate convincing but false information (hallucinations)."
